## Victor Kaiser-Pendergrast's Vim Config ##
Nothing too special here; this is mostly a collection of a few well known plugins.

## Almost Special Bindings ##
- `\<ctrl-l\>` toggles between absolute and relative line numbers
- `\\d` and `\\dd` delete to the black hole register
- Mappings for common typos I make all the time
  - `:Tabp` `:W` `:Wqa` `:Wq`
- `:CDHere` changes to currently file's directory

## Plugins ##
- NERDTree
- NERDTreeTabs
- Pathogen
- Eclim
- EasyMotion
- Maybe others I don't remember
